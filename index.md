# Introduction

The exponential growth of data, often referred to as Big Data, presents significant challenges for traditional relational database systems (RDBMS). These systems struggle to manage the high volume, speed, and variety of data generated by modern applications. Apache CassandraTM is a massively scalable and distributed NoSQL database designed to address these limitations. Cassandra, rooted in the technology of big data giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, was open-sourced by Facebook to the Apache Foundation in 2009. It has since become a cornerstone for modern businesses managing critical data infrastructure. Known for its high performance and continuous uptime, Cassandra handles massive scale efficiently, making it essential for big data applications across various industries.

As a free and open-source, distributed, wide-column store NoSQL database management system, Cassandra is designed to manage large amounts of data across many commodity servers. It ensures high availability with no single point of failure, supports clusters spanning multiple data centers, and allows low-latency operations through asynchronous masterless replication. Cassandra excels in handling structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data, offering high availability, fault tolerance, and linear scalability.

This report explores the data model, features, advantages, limitations, and operational capabilities of Cassandra, along with a demonstration of basic CRUD operations.

# Background and Development

Cassandra was originally developed at Facebook to power the Inbox Search feature, which needed to handle high write throughput and provide efficient search capabilities across geographically distributed data centers. Launched in June 2008 for around 100 million users, Cassandra now supports over 250 million users and serves as the backend storage system for multiple services within Facebook.

# Data Model and Features

Apache Cassandra employs a wide-column store data model, which allows for flexible schema definitions, significantly different from the row-based approach of relational databases. In Cassandra, data is stored in column families, similar to tables in relational databases but more flexible. Each row in a column family can have a different number of columns, making it suitable for handling sparse datasets.

The primary components of Cassandra’s data model include:

- **Keyspace**: The outermost container for data, similar to a database in relational systems.
- **Table**: Contains rows and columns, where each row is identified by a unique key.
- **Column Family**: A collection of rows that share the same structure, allowing for dynamic
  columns.

## Key Features

1. **Scalability**: Cassandra is designed to scale horizontally, handling large volumes of data
   across many commodity servers without a single point of failure. Users can add more nodes
   to the cluster without downtime.
2. **High Availability**: Its decentralized architecture ensures high availability and resilience,
   with data automatically replicated across multiple nodes. Cassandra can handle node failures
   gracefully with no single point of failure.
3. **Fault Tolerance**: Data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that the system remains
   operational even if some nodes fail.
4. **Decentralized Architecture**: Cassandra uses a peer-to-peer protocol to communicate
   across nodes, ensuring no master node exists, and every node in the cluster is equal.
5. **Tunable Consistency**: Users can configure consistency levels per operation, balancing
   strong consistency and eventual consistency based on their requirements.
6. **Flexible Schema**: The schema can be modified without downtime, allowing for rapid
   development and iteration.

# Justification for Development

Apache Cassandra was developed to address the limitations of relational databases, particularly in handling large-scale, distributed data. Traditional relational databases struggle with horizontal scaling and often require costly, complex configurations to achieve high availability. In contrast, Cassandra offers a more straightforward, cost-effective solution.

## Advantages over Relational Databases

- **Scalability**: Cassandra’s ability to scale horizontally means adding more nodes to the cluster
  increases its capacity and performance linearly.
- **Performance**: Optimized for write-heavy workloads, Cassandra efficiently manages large
  volumes of data with minimal latency, making it suitable for applications like logging and
  real-time analytics.
- **High Write Throughput**: Designed for high write-intensive workloads, Cassandra can
  handle large volumes of data with minimal latency.
- **Tunable Consistency**: The flexibility to choose consistency levels for different operations
  provides a balance between performance and data integrity.
- **Distributed Architecture**: Its masterless architecture allows for easy data distribution
  across multiple data centers, enhancing performance and availability.
- **Support for Big Data**: Cassandra can handle large datasets efficiently, making it ideal for
  big data applications.

## Limitations

- **Eventual Consistency**: While tunable, Cassandra’s default eventual consistency model
  may not suit applications requiring strict consistency.
- **Complex Querying**: Compared to SQL databases, Cassandra lacks advanced querying
  capabilities, such as joins and subqueries, making it less suitable for complex analytics.
- **Complexity**: The learning curve for Cassandra can be steep, especially for those familiar
  with relational databases.

## Application Areas

- **Real-time Big Data Applications**: Cassandra excels in environments where real-time
  data processing is crucial, such as fraud detection systems and recommendation engines.
- **IoT**: Its ability to handle high write throughput and large volumes of time-series data makes
  Cassandra ideal for IoT applications.
- **Social Media**: Platforms like Instagram and Facebook use Cassandra to manage large
  volumes of user data and interactions efficiently.

## Storage Architecture

Cassandra’s storage architecture is built on a distributed, partitioned row store model, designed for high performance and scalability. Data is partitioned across the cluster using consistent hashing, ensuring even distribution and efficient data retrieval. Each partition is a collection of rows, with each row containing columns identified by a unique key. The system uses a log-structured merge-tree (LSM tree) for efficient write operations, where data is written to a memory table (Memtable) and periodically flushed to disk as SSTables (Sorted String Tables).

## Scalability

Cassandra supports horizontal scalability through data partitioning and replication. Adding more nodes to the cluster seamlessly increases its capacity and ensures load balancing. This capability enables the database to handle increased loads without compromising performance. Data is replicated across multiple nodes to provide fault tolerance and high availability.

## Query Capabilities

Cassandra uses the Cassandra Query Language (CQL), which resembles SQL but is tailored for its column-based model. CQL allows users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and supports secondary indexes and materialized views for efficient querying. Concurrency Control Features Cassandra employs an eventual consistency model, allowing for high availability and partition tolerance. It uses tunable consistency, enabling developers to choose the level of consistency required for their applications, ranging from eventual to strong consistency. This flexibility lets users prioritize performance or consistency based on their application needs.

## Fault Tolerance

Cassandra ensures fault tolerance through data replication. Each piece of data is replicated across multiple nodes, ensuring that the system can automatically handle node failures without data loss. Features like hinted handoff and repair mechanisms help maintain data consistency and availability.

# Demo of Basic CRUD Operations

## 1. Create

Inserting data into Cassandra involves defining a table and adding rows. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
user_id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
name TEXT,
email TEXT,
created_at TIMESTAMP
);

```

```sql
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name, email) VALUES (1, 'Min Thu Khaing', '0x@bontal.net');
```

## 2. Read

Querying data is straightforward with CQL. For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;
```

## 3. Update

Updating existing data is done using the UPDATE statement:

```sql
UPDATE users SET email = 'MinThuKhaing@uon.edu.au' WHERE user_id = 1;
```

## 4. Delete

Deleting data is similarly simple:

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE user_id = 1;
```

# Conclusion

Apache Cassandra is a robust and scalable NoSQL database, ideal for applications that demand high write throughput and the ability to handle large amounts of data across distributed systems. Its column-family data model and decentralized architecture provide flexibility and high availability, making it a suitable choice for real-time big data applications, IoT, and social media platforms.

While Cassandra offers many advantages, such as horizontal scalability and tunable consistency, it also has some limitations. The eventual consistency model may not be suitable for all applications, and its querying capabilities are less advanced than those of traditional SQL databases.

Despite these challenges, Cassandra’s strengths in handling large-scale data workloads, high write throughput, and fault tolerance make it a valuable tool in the NoSQL database landscape. As technology continues to evolve, improvements in Cassandra’s capabilities and user-friendliness are likely, further solidifying its position as a leading NoSQL database solution.
